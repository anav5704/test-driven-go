# Test Driven Go ðŸ”·

I had gotten tired of building Next.js apps so I decided to go a bit low level and try out Go. The book I was learning from, [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests), was a great help and it was a nice introduction to test driven development. I highly recommend the book if you wish to try out Go too.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have [GoLang](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed. Then, cd into the directory you want to test and run the following command:

```
go test
```
